Having fun solving problems on waiting times

### About working environment

Problems are presented in jupyter notebooks running R kernel. I use Anaconda with R-essentials installed. See [anaconda documentation](https://anaconda.org/r/r-essentials) to install it. Or reproduce the conda environment using the file environment.yml and this [conda instructions](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file).

### About problems
Over time I have come across some cool and interesting problems on waiting times and stopping times. Some of them can be solved exactly using maths (probability), However, I am really interested in getting numerical solutions via simulations, since sometimes this is an easier approach and looking at plots with convergent quantities makes my day.
